Documentation for ALA install

####Contributing to the documentation####

We welcome direct contribution to this documentation project. Please announce your interest by posting your github account to the [ALA Portal mailing list](http://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/ala-portal) and we will grant you the permission to push.

1. We maintain documentation mainly by using the wiki. To clone the wiki repo, you do:

    $ git clone https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation.wiki.git

2. This documentation repository will remain empty and only use the wiki part for documentation. This means we don't work on the https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation.git repo but https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation.wiki.git.

If you happened to any problems, or have any questions and suggestions, please feel free to file an issue here. Thanks!
