Documentation for ALA install
=============

This is the documentation project for the [ALA install](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ala-install). We will priorise topics/areas so they form the basis of the documentation of the ALA project, as well as how to contribute and provide feedback. Please go straight to [the wiki page](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation/wiki).

We welcome direct contribution to this documentation project. Please announce your interest by posting your github account to the [ALA Portal mailing list](http://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/ala-portal) and we will grant you the permission to push.

####Principles####
1. We maintain documentation mainly by using the wiki. To clone the wiki repo, you do:

    $ git clone https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation.wiki.git

2. We for now deliberately keep this documentation project itself empty and only use the wiki part for documentation. This means we don't work on the https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation.git repo but https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation.wiki.git.

If you happened to any problems, or have any questions and suggestions, please feel free to file an issue here. Thanks!
